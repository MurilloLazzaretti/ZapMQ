## 🧬 Resources

🚲 In any type of message, you will send/recive a JSON object.

Already implemented types of messages :

👂 _Publisher and Subscriber_

Send a message to a dermined queue with <b>no answer.</b> "One" of the "N" subscribers registered in this queue will process your message.  

🔌 _RPC_ 

Send a JSON object to a dermined queue with <b> answer.</b> "One" of the "N" subscribers registered in this queue will process your message and send an answer to the publisher. 

🌐 _Exchange_ (Coming soon)

Send a message to a dermined queue with <b>no answer.</b> "All" of the subscribers registered in this queue will process your message. 

## 🕗 Performance

We are current in a beta version, so we dont have numbers about how many messages the ZapMQ can recive in a second or how many it can send in a second, but if you need a high performance like Kafka, RabbitMQ or others messages brokers this is not your place. ZapMQ was not developed to have an extremely high performance.

ZapMQ cant work in a cluster architecture too.

We think that ZapMQ can send/recive like 300 messages per second (or something more), but we dont put it in a tester yet. 

## 🌱 Wrappers

Implemented Wrappers for now :

| _Language_ | _Status_        | _Link_            |
